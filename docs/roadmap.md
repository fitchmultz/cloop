# Cloop Roadmap

This is the canonical roadmap for Cloop.

The current priority is to promote the canonical continuity summary feed into calm notifications and automation-ready operator digests, so the same backend-authored workflow-summary identities can drive future nudges, scheduler surfaces, and summary delivery without per-surface drift.

## Direction

Cloop should feel like a local-first execution OS for human + AI operational work.

Current product goals:

- Replace subsystem-first navigation with state-driven workflows.
- Make the default experience answer: what should I do now, what needs a decision, and what changed.
- Keep planning, review, chat, and enrichment outputs grounded in explicit action surfaces with previews, rationale, and rollback cues.
- Preserve deterministic local control while letting AI accelerate preparation, synthesis, handoff, and rerun.
- Reuse shared service and execution contracts across HTTP, web, CLI, and MCP instead of inventing per-surface workflow logic.
- Keep the product calm by default and deep on demand through progressive disclosure.
- Make high-frequency operator flows keyboard-fast.
- Surface provenance, assumptions, reversibility, and rerun semantics anywhere the system proposes or re-executes meaningful work.

## UX Vision and Spec Set

- Shared UX principles: [`docs/ux/principles.md`](ux/principles.md)

## Shipped foundation

The next roadmap slice starts from work that is already live:

- TypeScript/Vite operator-shell cutover with state-driven shell routing
- operator workspace foundation and state-oriented navigation model
- working-set sessions, focus mode, and working-set-aware handoffs
- shared trust surfaces and shared AI/action-card rendering across planning, review, recall, and follow-through flows
- post-action receipt cards with resume targets and rollback cues
- review workspace redesign across relationship, enrichment, and hygiene review
- durable backend-backed continuity outcomes and resume anchors with browser-local visit baselines still preserved for local drift comparison
- durable last-seen continuity markers for planning sessions, review sessions, workflow threads, and review cohorts
- backend-authored workflow-summary continuity across operator home, the receipt rail, and command-palette recents
- drift-aware since-last summaries and resume ranking driven by durable evidence instead of recency-first local history
- proactive operator guidance with one featured deterministic next move, a calm why-this-won digest, and a Recommended command-palette group
- explicit continuity recovery flows for superseded or unavailable workflows across operator cards, the receipt rail, and command-palette recommendations
- bounded read-only alternate generation strategies with surfaced provenance metadata
- shared rerun and refresh affordances across planning, saved review sessions, recall result cards, continuity, CLI, HTTP, and MCP

## Execution order

### Next — Continuity notifications and automation-ready summary digests

**Primary specs:**
- [`docs/ux/continuity-intelligence.md`](ux/continuity-intelligence.md)
- [`docs/ux/outcome-continuity.md`](ux/outcome-continuity.md)
- [`docs/ux/workflow-handoffs.md`](ux/workflow-handoffs.md)

Goal: reuse the shipped backend-authored workflow-summary feed to drive calm operator notifications, digest delivery, and future automation hooks from one canonical continuity identity model instead of per-surface heuristics.

Why this comes next:
- ranked workflow summaries, recommendation explanations, recovery acknowledgements, and summary last-seen markers now live in the shared backend continuity snapshot
- broader notification or automation work was intentionally blocked on having one canonical continuity feed first
- future nudges, scheduler hints, and digest delivery should now start from workflow-summary identities instead of rebuilding ranking logic again in new surfaces

Planned sequence:

1. define backend-authored notification/digest records sourced from ranked workflow summaries and their stable identities
2. expose those records through the continuity/scheduler surfaces that need calm operator-facing delivery
3. cut operator-facing digest or notification consumers over to the canonical summary-derived records instead of synthesizing bespoke reminder copy client-side
4. preserve acknowledgement, suppression, and last-seen semantics against the same workflow-summary identities so future nudges stay stable across refreshes and devices

## Delivery model

- Keep `docs/roadmap.md` concise and ordered.
- Use linked UX specs for detailed workflows, interaction models, contract implications, and acceptance criteria.
- Remove completed roadmap items instead of marking them done.
- Update the relevant spec when implementation materially changes intended behavior.
- Land UX changes as end-to-end workflow slices once a spec is accepted, not as isolated visual polish.

## Guardrails

- Do not add UI polish without improving workflow clarity, confidence, or speed.
- Prefer state-driven UX over feature-driven navigation.
- Prefer action surfaces over narrative AI output.
- Do not reintroduce legacy plain-JS frontend paths; all operator-shell and work-surface runtime work belongs in the TypeScript/Vite frontend.
- Keep all AI recommendations grounded in real loops, memory, RAG, or explicit operator context.
- Preserve deterministic escape hatches and visible rollback cues for meaningful mutations.
- Avoid transport-specific workflow drift; shared orchestration remains the source of truth.
- Treat `make ci` as the release gate for every milestone.
